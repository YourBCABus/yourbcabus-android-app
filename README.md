# YourBCABus Android
This is the repo for the YourBCABus android app (`com.yourbcabus.android.yourbcabus`).

If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the project and submit a PR.
Although some development happens on `master`, it is requested that new features get merged from other branches.
When code is ready to be deployed to the Google Play Store, it will get merged to the `prod` branch.

Before merging to `prod`, ensure you have completed the following:
- You have tested the code currently in `master`
- You have updated the `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle`
- You have updated the release notes in `app/src/main/play/release-notes/en-US/default.txt`
